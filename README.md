# baseballr

A package written for R focused on baseball analysis. 

The package is in a very early development stage, it has not been compiled, etc. You can experiment with the individual functions (which can be found [here](https://github.com/BillPetti/baseballr/tree/master/baseballr)), just be sure to have the dplyr, rvest, XML, and reldist packages installed and loaded.
