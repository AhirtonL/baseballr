The latest release of the [`baseballr`](https://billpetti.github.io/baseballr/) (0.3.1) includes a function for acquiring player statistics from the [NCAA's website](http://stats.ncaa.org) for baseball teams across the three major divisions (I, II, III).

The function, `ncaa_scrape`, requires the user to pass values for three parameters for the function to work:

`school_id`: numerical code used by the NCAA for each school
`year`: a four-digit year
`type`: whether to pull data for batters or pitchers

If you want to pull batting statistics for Vanderbilt for the 2013 season, you would use the following:

```r
> baseballr::ncaa_scrape(736, 2013, "batting") %>%
+     select(year:OBPct)

The same can be done for pitching, just by changing the `type` parameter:

```r
> baseballr::ncaa_scrape(736, 2013, "pitching") %>%

```

Now, the function is dependent on the user knowing the `school_id` used by the NCAA website. Given that, I've included a `school_id_lu` function so that users can find the `school_id` they need.

Just pass a string to the function and it will return possible matches based on the school's name:

```r
> school_id_lu("Vand")
# A tibble: 4 Ã— 6
      school   conference school_id  year division conference_id
       <chr>        <chr>     <dbl> <dbl>    <dbl>         <dbl>

2 Vanderbilt Southeastern       736  2014        1           911
3 Vanderbilt Southeastern       736  2015        1           911
4 Vanderbilt Southeastern       736  2016        1           911
```
